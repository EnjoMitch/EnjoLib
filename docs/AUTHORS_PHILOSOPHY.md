# Author's philosophy 
I'm a passionate programmer, focusing on efficiency of work (better do less but do it well) and clean solutions (anything above Assembly level is meant to be written **for humans**). 
Following these values is able to create wonderful feedback loops in your mind, able to heal the damage, that the IT industry inflicts on you daily.

I have experience with `Java`, `C#` and `Python` as well. I like to take the best out of each language. Ultimately, what matters is not what specific syntax sugar of a given language you use, but the proper and readable design. After all, you want to be able to reuse a given algo in other languages as well, after just a quick adaptation.

I like to optimize certain parts of the code for runtime speed, but not until these parts are proven to be bottlenecks through measurement tools like [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) or even [Profiling by Pausing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/266373/one-could-use-a-profiler-but-why-not-just-halt-the-program), if no profiling tools are available. The motto I follow here is: "*Don't optimize yet*", coined by [John Bentley](https://medium.com/@sschillace/coding-principles-every-engineer-should-know-b946b48cc946). I hate the dominating dogma in the IT sector ("*I just know this is a bottleneck, because I read this in a book of XYZ Guru.*"). Many "proofs" of such claims are prepared only to proove the claim itself in a perfect isolation and are, strictly speaking, detached from any reality. 

Here's a real life example: A dogmatic person argues, that since inlining functions in his "proof" example, where the functions are tiny and called million of times, leads to repeatable and measurable tripling of the execution speed, now **all** the small functions need to be inlined, even if inlining them leads to additional header inclusions inside the current header. 
The rest of the dogmatic and passive team immediately concurs, inline every small function, leading to a massive increase in compilation time, caused now by cascaded inclusion of headers, ultimately bringing the project to a halt. Oh. I almost forgot to add. The promised 3x overall runtime speedup was never achieved with the inlining technique for the reason, that even though the small (in terms of lines of code, not the included header tree) functions were indeed being called 3x faster, all of these functions in question **in the real application** attributed for only 1% of the **total** runtime cost. 
Therefore the whole application now runs by whooping 0.67% times faster. I'm so sorry for bursting your bubble, kid. Even an extremely short `Valgrind` session would show you this relationship, before you even started your death march.

For me, what counts is observation/measurement, modeling, testability, reproducibility and finally generalization once it becomes possible, thus extraction of the working idea into a form of an abstract and reusable module. Only this way you may grow, rather than keep moving in circles (unless that's exactly what you're being paid for, eh?).

Regarding the newschool and trending project management methods, "Agile" for me means "flexible" by **all** means and not just by being able to move around in yet another rusty cage, but of a different colour. 
The industry's take of it is that "Agile" quickly regressed into Waterfall with even more micromanagement and artificial deadlines, "cuz these smarta$$es can't be trusted.", which through prolonged demotivation of the most important actors, the Devs (no, I didn't mean the managers), ultimately leads projects to collapse, until only the new business cycle is able to refubrish them. And this can happen only **if** the customer is still naive enough to believe in the supplier's sugar coated lies.

Well, that's all about me! 

If, after reading my exhale of arrogance, you still haven't smashed the screen in rage to pieces, then you've just passed the test :) Welcome and please use the code freely in accordance to the licenses. If you'd like to give something back, then roll up your sleeves and please read [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md). Don't worry - I don't bite. I only bite the hipocritic industry back :)
